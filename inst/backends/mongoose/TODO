- support for HTTP chunked encoding PUT upload
  (we emit chunked output, but can't take it yet; due to a limitation in curl, this effectively limits uploads through curl (R) to 2GB.
- Add ?sync query variable option to PUT
- check file locking in PUT
- service and package installation and scripts (all operating systems)
- implement find operation. One idea for this, where 'dir' is a directory path:
  http://localhost:8000/dir?find=filename
